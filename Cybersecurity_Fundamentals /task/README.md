> ## 📰 The Brief Just Landed
>
> ConnectSphere's founders just walked out of a term sheet meeting. Two investors are ready to write checks for their Series A — **contingent on passing a security due-diligence review in fourteen days**. The CTO has no in-house security hire yet. She's brought you in, on retainer, as an **Independent Cybersecurity Governance Consultant**, to assess the platform's design and processes before the investors' own auditors do. Whatever you flag now, you fix before someone else finds it for you.

Welcome to ConnectSphere, a rapidly growing professional networking startup. Your role is to assess ConnectSphere's system design and processes for governance, risk, compliance, and security integrity.

## Objectives

- **Identify Security Risks** — Detect and classify risks in the ConnectSphere platform related to data protection, access control, and system design.
- **Apply Cybersecurity Principles** — Reference and apply core cybersecurity frameworks such as the CIA Triad, Principle of Least Privilege, and Secure SDLC practices.
- **Ensure Compliance** — Assess how the system aligns with international privacy and security standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Recommend Actionable Fixes** — Provide practical, role-specific mitigations and governance improvements.

## Scenario: The Flawed ConnectSphere Architecture

ConnectSphere's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) allows users to create professional profiles, register for events, and communicate via an in-app messaging system. However, an internal audit has flagged potential cybersecurity weaknesses in the system's architecture diagram.

**Preliminary concerns from the internal security review:**

- Sensitive data (PII) is transmitted over unencrypted channels.
- API endpoints may be overly permissive, exposing user data.
- The system lacks input validation, leaving it open to injection attacks.
- Access control roles are not well-defined, risking privilege escalation.
- No incident response or logging mechanisms are in place.

**Your task:** review the project brief and architecture diagram for your assigned set (see [Set 1](#set-1-project-brief) and [Set 2](#set-2-project-brief) below), identify the most critical risks, and propose governance-aligned mitigations.

## Required Deliverables

### Deliverable 1: Cybersecurity Governance Review Card

Complete the table below with **three distinct risk findings and one monitoring recommendation**. Each finding must reference a core cybersecurity principle (e.g., CIA Triad, PoLP, Input Validation).

| Section | Issue / Definition | Impact | Suggested Fix / Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Confidentiality Risk** | | | |
| **2. Integrity Risk** | | | |
| **3. Availability Risk** | | | |
| **4. Monitoring / Reporting Recommendation** | Metric to Monitor (name & definition) | Visualization Type (e.g., Line, Bar, Heatmap) | Why It Matters (one sentence) |

### Deliverable 2: Corrected Architecture Diagram

Using your assigned ConnectSphere User Flow Diagram, **annotate at least three corrections**. Each annotation must briefly explain what change was made and why.

Key flaws to identify and correct:

- Missing encryption (HTTPS / TLS)
- Weak or missing access control on APIs
- No input validation or sanitization
- No secure session management
- No audit logging or incident response

> ✏️ **Example correction annotation**
>
> *"Implement HTTPS encryption for all data transmission — protects user PII and ensures data-in-transit confidentiality."*

### Deliverable 3: Summary of Review Process (200–300 words)

Write a short summary explaining your review process. Address:

- How you applied cybersecurity governance principles (CIA Triad, PoLP, SSDLC).
- How your findings improve ConnectSphere's compliance and data protection posture.
- Why your recommended monitoring metric supports ethical and transparent cybersecurity governance.
